## How to execute
If you want to execute this Program locally you have to do it in the Console.
### Step 1
Open your console. On Windows it's prefferably PowerShell
### Step 2
Check if you have node installed. It is an important part of the execution. You can check that by typing ```node -v```. If a version number is printed, you know that it is installed. If you do not have it, install it first. You can do that [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
### Step 3
Open your console in the root folder of the programm. There you type in ```npm start```. This will start a live server on port 3000. Keep in mind, that port 3000 has to be free. If it started without any problems you should be able to view it unter [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Alternative
